Quicksnap
=========

Quicksnap is a tool that lets you easily take screenshots, edit them and upload them.

Screenshots taken by the application can be cropped, highlighted as well as written over.
The final product can be either uploaded to Imgur or saved to your local filesystem.

It was developed by a group of students as a class project over a period of two weeks. The application
works but lacks polish.
